# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the robotic nervous system that provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It includes hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.

### Key Components:
- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/reply communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous request/reply communication with feedback

## Module 2: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

Gazebo provides realistic simulation of robotic environments with accurate physics, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic interfaces.

### Features:
- Dynamic simulation with multiple physics engines
- High-quality graphics rendering
- Sensor simulation
- Plugin system for custom functionality

## Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is NVIDIA's robotics simulator that provides a scalable solution for developing, testing, and validating robot applications in realistic environments.

## Module 4: Voice-to-Action Systems

Modern robotics increasingly incorporates voice interfaces to enable natural human-robot interaction.
